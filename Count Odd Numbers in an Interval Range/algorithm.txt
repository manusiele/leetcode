 * The key insight is that in any consecutive range, odd numbers appear 
 * roughly every 2 numbers.
 * 
 * Logic Breakdown:
 * 1. (high - low) / 2 gives us the base count of pairs
 * 2. (low % 2 | high % 2) adds 1 if either endpoint is odd
 * 
 * Why this works:
 * - If both low and high are even: [8,10] → (10-8)/2 + 0 = 1 ✓ (only 9)
 * - If low is odd, high is even: [3,8] → (8-3)/2 + 1 = 3 ✓ (3,5,7)
 * - If low is even, high is odd: [2,7] → (7-2)/2 + 1 = 3 ✓ (3,5,7)
 * - If both are odd: [3,7] → (7-3)/2 + 1 = 3 ✓ (3,5,7)
 * 
 * Alternative Formula (equally valid):
 * return (high + 1) / 2 - low / 2;
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
