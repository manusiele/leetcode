Key Insight
We need sum(left) - sum(right) to be even.
Let:

total = sum(nums)
left_sum = sum(nums[0..i])
right_sum = total - left_sum

Then:
textdifference = left_sum - right_sum 
           = left_sum - (total - left_sum)
           = 2 * left_sum - total
difference is even ⇔ 2 * left_sum - total is even ⇔ total and left_sum have the same parity
(because 2×anything is always even)
Conclusion:
A partition at index i is valid if and only if
sum(nums[0..i]) and total sum are both even or both odd.
Optimal Algorithm (O(n) time, O(1) space)

Compute total = sum(nums)
Compute total_parity = total % 2
Initialize left_sum = 0, count = 0
Iterate i from 0 to n-2:
left_sum += nums[i]
If left_sum % 2 == total_parity → valid partition → count++

Return count

Proof of Correctness
From above:
difference even ⇔ left_sum and total have same parity
We check exactly that condition for every possible split point.
