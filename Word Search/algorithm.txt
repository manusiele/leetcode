Algorithm – Word Search (LeetCode 79)
Core Idea: Backtracking + DFS
We try to find the word by exploring all possible paths in the grid, starting from every cell that matches the first letter.
For each starting position, we perform a DFS:

Move up/down/left/right (4 directions)
Mark visited cells temporarily (to prevent reuse)
If we match the entire word → return True
If no path works → backtrack

Steps:

Get dimensions: ROWS, COLS
If word is empty → return True (edge case)
Define DFS function:Pythondef dfs(r, c, i):  # i = current index in word
    # Base cases
    if i == len(word): 
        return True
    if (r < 0 or r >= ROWS or c < 0 or c >= COLS or
        board[r][c] != word[i]):
        return False
    
    # Mark as visited (temporarily)
    temp = board[r][c]
    board[r][c] = "#"
    
    # Explore 4 directions
    found = (dfs(r+1, c, i+1) or
             dfs(r-1, c, i+1) or
             dfs(r, c+1, i+1) or
             dfs(r, c-1, i+1))
    
    # Unmark (backtrack)
    board[r][c] = temp
    
    return found
Try DFS from every cell where board[r][c] == word[0]
If any DFS returns True → return True
Else → return False
